      <h2>What is TCP?</h2>
      <h4>TCP is a transmission protocol used by a large percentage of network applications. It is one of the oldest transfer protocols but also, thanks to its versatility, it is one of the most useful ones (and the de facto transfer protocol which acts as a baseline for most new ones). TCP has several desirable properties like, for instance, guaranteed transmission. However, it also involves much overhead which ends up negatively impacting its latency (its latency is a couple of orders of magnitude over the hardware limit). This makes TCP less than ideal for situations where a high volume of small messages is expected.</h4>
